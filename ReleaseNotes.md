# Release Notes

## Ver 1.3.2.1 âœ¨

In this version, we have made several fixes and improvements to the project. The main changes include:

Enhanced Theme Switching
The theme switching functionality now provides a smoother and more pleasant experience. When transitioning to the snow mode, the switch is no longer instantaneous but rather gradual, reducing the impact on the user's eyes.

## Ver 1.3.2 âœ¨

In this update (Version 1.3.2), I focused on improving the user experience with a more enhanced notification block. Here are the key changes made:
- **Display Speed:** The notification block now appears faster, providing immediate feedback for actions such as copying content to the clipboard.
- **Fade-out Time:** The disappearance of the notification block has been reduced for a quicker and smoother transition.
- **Background Color:** The background color of the notification block has been slightly darkened to improve visibility while maintaining transparency.
- **Opacity Animation:** The opacity transition in and out of the notification block has been optimized, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing experience.
